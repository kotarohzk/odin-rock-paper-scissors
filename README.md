# Odin Rock Paper Scissors

This is the third project of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) which mainly involves the use of JavaScript to create a web page that facilitates user interaction. Things that I have learned:

- targeting nodes in JavaScript
- modifying node attributes/properties/content
- using array methods on NodeList
- registering event listeners on nodes and using callbacks to handle events
- randomly select an element from an array
- using the data-\* custom attribute to embed data/information on HTML elements
